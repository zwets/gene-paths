# gene-paths

_Determine gene order and orientation in assemblies._


## Requirements

* C++ compiler supporting the C++14 standard
* (not yet) BLAST+ suite (`blastn`, `makeblastdb`)


## Installation

* `cd src && make && make test`


## Usage

`gene-paths` searches an assembly graph (in GFA format) for the shortest
path between locations on the graph.

* `src/gene-paths --help`

#### Examples

* `gene-paths assembly.gfa ctg1+ ctg2+`

  Searches `assembly.gfa` for the shortest path starting with `ctg1` and
  ending with `ctg2`.

* `gene-paths assembly.gfa ctg1:$- ctg2:0+`

  Returns the shortest path from the end of the - strand of `ctg1` to the
  start of `ctg2`. 

* `gene-paths assembly.gfa ctg1:100:$- ctg2:300+`

  Returns the shortest path from genomic region 100-$ on the minus strand
  of `ctg1`, to the base at pos 300 on the plus strand of `ctg2+`.

* `gene-paths assembly.gfa ctg+ ctg:0+`

  Find the shortest path starting with `ctg+` and ending at its left hand
  side, i.e. the shortest _cyclical_ path from and to `ctg`.


## Background

### Motivation

These tools  were developed to help answer the question "where are genes
relative to each other?"  For instance, when typing _Staphyloccos aureus_
SCCmec cassettes, it is relevant whether IS431 is up- or downstream of the
_mecA_ gene, and whether it is inverted.

This question is simple to answer if the features are on a single contig in
the genome assembly.  Unfortunately this is often not the case, especially
when repetitions and mobile elements are involved.

It would seem that if we find features A and B on separate contigs, we are
out of luck.  Not knowing what is between the contigs, or even their order,
we can't tell which of A or B is upstream, whether one is inverted relative
to the other, and certainly not their distance.  Or so you'd think.

You may be surprised to learn that quite the opposite is true.

The lengths of contigs in an assembly are not generally limited by a lack
of data, i.e. no reads to cover their continuation.  On the contrary, usually
there are reads, but these imply multiple _different_ continuations, meaning
the contig cannot be extended further unambiguously.

In the assembly graph this could look like this:

     _                    ___ contig 2 ___                
      \                  /                \
       +--- contig 1 ---+                  +--- contig 4 ---
     _/                  \___ contig 3 ___/

Here contig 1 cannot be extended further, because in some place on the genome
it is followed by the sequence captured in contig 2, whereas elsewhere it is
followed by the sequence of contig 3.

However, if we know that our genes of interest are on contigs 1 and 2, then,
with the knowledge of the assembly graph, we can actually find their genomic
distance, relative orientation, and order.  In fact, we can know the exact
nucleotide sequence connecting the two genes.

Even if the features were located on contigs 1 and 4, we could still put a
bound on their genomic distance, and (with a bit of luck) find out their
relative orientation and order.

It is remarkable how much information we discard by routinely working with
assembled contigs rather than assembly graphs.  This was the motivation for
writing `gene-paths`: to have a tool to rapidly query an assembly graph for
paths between arbitrary regions on its contigs.

### Caveats

Clearly, as the number of edges between the features of interest increases,
the number of possible paths connecting them rapidly explodes.  It is already
impossible to predict from this section of the graph:

                   __ contig 2 __                  __ contig 5 __
                  /              \                /              
    -- contig 1--+                +-- contig 4 --+              
                  \__ contig 3 __/                \__ contig 6 __

which of the sequences `1-2-4-5`, `1-2-4-6`, `1-3-4-5`, `1-3-4-6` are present
with certainty on the genome (though we know that at least two must be, and
that each contains contigs 1 and 4).

An important point to remember as well is that _shortest path_ does not imply
that it represents biological reality.


### FAQ

#### How are assembly graphs stored?

The GFA format is the de facto standard for assembly graphs.  Its spec is
maintained at <https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec>.
[GFA2](https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA2.md) is the
current recommended format, and can be easily upgraded to from GFA v1.

#### How do I get an assembly graph?

* [SPAdes](http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/) by default writes the assembly
  graph to `contigs.gfa`, but note the points made about overlap removal in
  the [Unicycler documentation](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler#background).
* [Unicycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler) and its successor,
  [Trycycler](https://github.com/rrwick/Trycycler/wiki) optimise SPAdes and
  can perform hybrid short and long read assembly.
* [SKESA](https://github.com/ncbi/SKESA.git) can generate assembly graphs for
  assemblies and reads using its `gfa_connector` utility.  SKESA's assemblies
  tend to be more fragmented than SPAdes's, but there is a
  [trade-off with speed and the number of misassemblies](https://cab.spbu.ru/benchmarking-tools-for-de-novo-microbial-assembly/).
* [SAUTE](https://github.com/ncbi/SKESA#saute---sequence-assembly-using-target-enrichment)
  was recently added to SKESA, and combines _de novo_ assembly with alignment
  to a reference, producing all paths through the assembly graph consistent
  with the reference.

#### Can I look at assembly graphs?

Yes, and it's very insightful.  Get the fabulous
[Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage) for visualisation.

#### What other tools work with GFA?

* [gfatools](https://github.com/lh3/gfatools) is a GFA parser with a succinct
  C implementation of data structures to hold assembly graphs.  It has tools
  to convert GFA to FASTA, BED, and SQL, and to perform miniasm-like
  transformations on the graph.
* [gfakluge](https://github.com/edawson/gfakluge) is a GFA parser and C++
  class library that maps one-to-one to the entities in GFA.  Its `gfak` tool
  converts between GFA formats, and can sort, subset, merge, and trim graphs.
* The [page on modularising assemblers](https://github.com/GFA-spec/assembler-components)
  will have more references of interest.
* [vg](https://github.com/vgteam/vg) is the nuclear option.  Whereas the tools
  above target GFA specifically, and (thus far) provide primarily parsers and
  basic data structures, VG is the tool of the trade for working with [genome
  variation graphs]().
