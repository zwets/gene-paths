/* Data structures inspired by https://github.com/lh3/gfatools.
 *
 * A segment is a sequence with length and data.  A vertex is one side of
 * the segment, and corresponds to the + or - orientation of the segment.
 * The sequence data in the + and - orientations are reverse complements.
 * Segments store the data for the + orientation.
 *
 * Segments and vertices are identified by indices.  The two vertices of
 * segment seg_ix are given by seg_ix<<1|ori, thus seg_ix = vtx_ix>>1.
 *
 * GFA2 allows arbitrary overlaps between segments in an edge, allowing:
 *
 *      \         / s1
 *       \_______/       Segments s1 and s2 overlap in the middle
 *       /       \
 *      /         \ s2
 *
 * Though this H-shape should not occur in final assembly graphs, we can
 * cater for it by slightly extending Heng Li's gfatools data model. That
 * model assumes that edges dovetail or do not overlap at all:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|
 *   v: -------------============
 *                     overlap
 *                w: ============--------------
 *                   |<-- ow -->|<---- lw ---->
 *
 * The gfatools model encodes the graph d as an array of directed arcs,
 * two per edge.  One leaves v at length lv, its complement leaves w' at
 * lw.  The arcs always arrive at 0 (on +) or $ (on -).
 *
 * Our extension is to additionally encode the lengths rv and rw, where
 * l{v,w} are upstream of the overlap, and r{v,w} downstream:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|<- rv ->|
 *   v: -------------============---------
 *                     overlap
 *       w: ---------============---------------
 *          |<- lw ->|<-- ow -->|<---- rw ---->|
 *
 * We then encode each edge as eight arcs, corresponding to going from
 * (1) v to w at (a) lv, (b) lv+ov, (2) w to v at (a) lw, (b) lw+ow, and
 * their four complements.  Iff ov=ow=0, there are no (b) arcs.
 *
 * Note that v and w above may be either + or -, as lv and lw are always
 * upstream of the overlap.  They are measured from 0 for a + segment,
 * and from $ for a - segment.
 *
 * As in gfatools, arcs are stored in an array sorted on v_lv, which is
 * vtx_ix<<32|lv, so that the outbound arcs from every vertex vtx_ix are
 * contiguous and sorted on how "early" they leave the vertex.
 *
 * -- Note 1: Dovetailing is special case rv=0 && lw=0 (or lv=0 && rw=0)
 *
 * It would seem that in this case there is no point in storing w_0→v_lv
 * and v'_0→w'_rw, but note that adding these arcs adds a path to the
 * overlap on the other segment from some other edge Z linked to w_0:
 *
 *   v: ------------->>>>>>>>>>>>
 *                w: ^===========---------------
 *        z: >>>>>>>>^
 *
 * -- Note 2: Non-overlap additionally has lv=$ && rw=$ (or rv=$ && lw=$)
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|
 *   v: --------------              (or v and w reversed)
 *                 w: ----------
 *                    |<- rw ->|
 *
 * Again, we do not eliminate w_0→v_lv or its complement v'_0→w'_rw, as
 * other arcs may continue (niche case ...) the path to other segments:
 *
 *                u: >>>>>>>>>>>>
 *   v: -------------^
 *                w: ^-------
 *
 * We can however leave out v_(lv+ov)→w_(lw+ow) and w_(lw+ow)→v_(lv+ov),
 * and their complements, as ov=ow=0 so they are equivalent to the first
 * arcs.
 *
 * -- Note 3: Zero-overlap can theoretically happen in middle too
 *
 * But we treat it the same as at the end, including the ov=ow=0 case.
 *
 * -- Note 4: Containment can now be expressed too
 *
 * And this will be convenient for defining paths, as the start and end
 * regions can be defined as containments:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|<- rv ->|
 *   v: -------------============---------
 *                w: ============             (lw=rw=0)
