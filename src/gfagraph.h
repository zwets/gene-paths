/* Data structures inspired by https://github.com/lh3/gfatools.
 *
 * A segment is a sequence with length and data.  A vertex is one side of
 * the segment, and corresponds to the + or - orientation of the segment.
 * The sequence data in the + and - orientations are reverse complements.
 * Segments and vertices are identified by indices.  The vertices of
 * segment seg_ix are given by seg_ix<<1|ori, thus seg_ix = vtx_ix>>1.
 *
 * GFA2 allows arbitrary overlaps between segments in an edge, allowing:
 *
 *      \         / s1
 *       \_______/       Segments s1 and s2 overlap in the middle
 *       /       \
 *      /         \ s2
 *
 * We do not allow these (though this could be resolved by spitting into
 * four dovetailing segments).  We will not normally encounter these,
 * and will only work with dovetails and blunt (non-overlapping) links.
 *
 * This means we can use Heng Li's arc model from gfatools.  An arc is a
 * directed edge between two vertices v and w:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|
 *   v: -------------============
 *                     overlap         
 *                w: ============------------->
 *                   |<-- ow -->|<---- lw ---->
 *
 * Values lv are lw are lengths that contribute to the sort order of the
 * arcs.  Arcs are identified by their index in the arcs vector.  For each
 * edge we store both the forward and complement arc.
 *
 * The arc array is kept sorted on (vtx_id<<32|vl), so that iteration over
 * the outbound arcs from any vertex is simple and efficient.
