The headers in this directory implement Eric T Dawson's GFAKluge,
which gene-paths uses to parse the GFA file.

GFAKluge and its dependency pliib are Copyright 2015 Eric T Dawson,

The tinyFA dependency was commented out as we do not use it, and
some minor patches applied to silence compiler warnings.
