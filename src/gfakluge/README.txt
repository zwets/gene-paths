The headers in this directory implement Eric T Dawson's GFAKluge,
which gene-paths uses to parse the GFA file.

GFAKluge is at <https://github.com/edawson/gfakluge>.

GFAKluge and its dependency pliib are Copyright 2015 Eric T Dawson,
licensed under the 'MIT' licence, included herewith.

Some minor patches were applied to silence compiler warnings and
work around the by-value passing of all data.

The tinyFA dependency was commented out as we do not use it.
