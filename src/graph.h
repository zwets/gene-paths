/* Data structures inspired by https://github.com/lh3/gfatools.
 *
 * A segment is a sequence with length and data.  A vertex is one side of
 * the segment, and corresponds to the + or - orientation of the segment.
 * The sequence data in the + and - orientations are reverse complements.
 * Segments store the data for the + orientation.
 *
 * Segments and vertices are identified by indices.  The two vertices of
 * segment seg_ix are given by seg_ix<<1|ori, thus seg_ix = vtx_ix>>1.
 *
 * GFA2 allows arbitrary overlaps between segments in an edge, allowing:
 *
 *      \         / s1
 *       \_______/       Segments s1 and s2 overlap in the middle
 *       /       \
 *      /         \ s2
 *
 * Though this H-shape should not occur in final assembly graphs, we can
 * cater for it by slightly extending Heng Li's gfatools data model. That
 * model assumes that edges dovetail or do not overlap at all:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|
 *   v: -------------============
 *                     overlap
 *                w: ============--------------
 *                   |<-- ow -->|<---- lw ---->
 *
 * The gfatools model encodes the graph d as an array of directed arcs,
 * two per edge.  One leaves v at length lv, its complement leaves w' at
 * lw.  The arcs always arrive at the head of the other segment.
 *
 * Our extension is to additionally encode the lengths rv and rw, where
 * l{v,w} are upstream of the overlap, and r{v,w} downstream:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|<- rv ->|
 *   v: -------------============---------
 *                     overlap
 *       w: ---------============---------------
 *          |<- lw ->|<-- ow -->|<---- rw ---->|
 *
 * To completely implement this model, each edge requires eight arcs:
 * - v:lv → w:lw, v:lv+ov → w:lw+ow, w:lw → v:lv, w:lw+ow → v:lv+ov
 * and their four complements:
 * - v':rv → w':rw, v':rv+ov → w':rw+ow, w':rw → v':rv, w':rw+ow → v':rv+ov
 *
 * As in gfatools, arcs are stored in an array sorted on v_lv, which is
 * vtx_ix<<32|lv, so that the outbound arcs from every vertex vtx_ix are
 * contiguous and sorted on how "early" they leave the vertex.
 *
 * -- Special case 1: ov = ow = 0
 *
 * If there is no overlap on either vertex (ov=ow=0), then half the arcs
 * coincide, so we are left with:
 *
 *   v:lv → w:lw, w:lw → v:lv, v':rv → w':rw, w':rw → v':rv
 *
 * Note that we don't need all four if the "overlap" is at the start/end
 * of the vertices (connecting them tail-to-head), as shown below.
 *
 * -- Special case 2: dovetailing (rv = lw = 0 || lv = rw = 0)
 *
 * This is as in the gfatools model above, except that in GFA2 arcs can
 * "land" anywhere on the destination.  So, in addition to v:lv → w:0 and
 * w':rw → v':0 , we also have v:lv+ov → w:ow and w':rw+ow → v':ov.
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|<-- ov -->|
 *   v: -------------============
 *                   ^          v 
 *                w: ============--------------
 *                   |<-- ow -->|<---- rw ---->
 *
 * Logically we also have their inverses, but they are odd: w:0 → v:lv
 * takes arrivals on w straight off to ov, and v':0 → w':rw does this
 * for arrivals on v': they never traverse the segment they came for.
 *
 * Also awkward are w:ow → v:$ and v':ov → w':$.  They take arrivals
 * over the overlap, but then to the end of the other vertex (without
 * including any of its bases), then hop onto any arc.
 *
 * -- Special case 3 = 1+2: bare links (ov=ow=0 && (rv=lw=0 || lv=rw=0))
 *
 * Combining special cases 1 & 2, we have non-overlapping links, with
 * arcs v:$ → w:0 and its complement w':$ → v':$, and their inverses:
 *
 *      |<--- lv --->|
 *   v: --------------              (or v and w reversed)
 *                 w: ----------
 *                    |<- rw ->|
 *
 * However the inverses (w:0 → v:$ and v':0 →w':$) are even weirder, as
 * they take arrivals on either vertex straight off the end of the other,
 * serving stricly as "transit station".
 *
 * == What to do with the "niche cases"?
 *
 * The links in SPAdes GFA output are mostly #3 or #2.  Unicycler seems
 * to produce only #3: bare links with no (or little) overlap.  Looking
 * at their typical L lines in GFA (simplified for clarity):
 *
 *     L * s1 s2 *
 *     L * s1 s3 *
 *     L * s4 s2 *
 *
 * Then should we make path s4-s3?  It is generated by s4→s2:0→s1:$→s3,
 * whereas no base on s2 or s1 is actually involved.  If it were real,
 * then it would have its own "L s4 s3". 

 * Adding "L s3 s2" to the above implies the path s3-s3, which certainly
 * doesn't look like it was intended, yet by the letter it is allowed.
 *
 * CONCLUSION: some subtle semantic context is lost after translating
 * GFA1 L nodes to GFA2's generic E nodes.  Safer to assume that the
 * "strange arcs" are unintentional.  This minimises the number of
 * possibly "false positive" paths.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MEANS: we do not create arcs that terminate at $ or start
 * at 0.
