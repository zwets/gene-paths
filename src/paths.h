/* This unit defines the data structures to hold paths over a graph.
 *
 * We define a path recursively as the "null" path or a path followed by
 * an arc.  An arc, as defined in graph.h, holds a source (v_lv) and
 * destination location (w_lv).  Locations consist of a vertex id (v, w),
 * and an offset from the start of the vertex (lv, lw).
 *
 * A way to think about paths is to view a gfa::graph as a metro network,
 * where the segments are lines (that travel in one direction, and where
 * you can get off at any point), and each arc is a station where you can
 * switch onto another line.
 *
 * A path then is a sequence of rides (on a segment) and hops (between
 * segments).  We do not store the rides, only the hops.  The rides are
 * implicit - they go from the w_lw of one hop to the v_lv of the next.
 *
 * This recursive definition of paths allows for very concise storage:
 * we keep an array of 'path_arc' objects, each representing a new path
 * by pointing back to an existing path, and adding an arc that extends
 * the path.
 *
 * When we later run Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path, the
 * vertices are the w_lw (ends) of the arcs, and the path to a vertex
 * can be updated to a shorter path by changing its back pointer.
