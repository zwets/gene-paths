// target - helper structure to capture start and end targets on a graph
//
// In order to find a path between the start and end regions, we add them
// as segments to the graph, but with arcs such that they are traversed
// only at the start and end of the path:
//
//      FROM seg     i------o           TO seg     i------x
//       arc s_o            v          arc e_i     ^
//        contig  ---b======e--->       contig  ---b======e--->
//
// The s_o (start-out) arc goes from the end of the FROM segment to the
// end of the target region on the contig.  Thus if we start the path at
// i, we first cover the target and then leave it (for good) over s_o.
//
// The e_i (end-in) arc is trickier.  We need to get to x (rather than i)
// so need an arc at x.  The solution is this:
//
//       "S" seg     S                 "E" seg            E
//       arc s_i     v                 arc e_o            ^
//      FROM seg     i------o           TO seg     i------x
//       arc s_o            v          arc e_i     ^
//        contig  ---b======e--->       contig  ---b======e--->
//
// We add two dummy zero-length segments that are the "terminals" for the
// the path search.  The path starts with arc s_i and ends with e_o.
// In fact we optimise and do with a single dummy of length 1, with s_i
// leaving it at 0, and e_o arriving at 1 (they can't find each other).
